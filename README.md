WordPress Blog - Project 2
====

####Objective####

To create a blog on WordPress.


####Requirements####

Live WordPress URL - http://jade.shearstone.yoobee.net.nz/

GitHub Repo URL - https://github.com/JadeCodes/blog


####Theme####

Name: Nova Lite - http://wordpress.org/themes/nova-lite 

*Why did I choose this theme?*

I started with this theme because I liked the basic black and white color scheme with the green hover. It has a simple design and layout. I have made some small tweaks to this using a child theme.

*Please note: Although this theme is available within WordPress, I initially found it through a Google search and downloaded the file on to my local drive, added it to my wp-content/themes folder and pushed it to my remote serve using FileZilla.*


####Plugins####

Name: Google Analytics Dashboard for WordPress - http://deconf.com/google-analytics-dashboard-wordpress/ 

*Why did I choose this plugin?*

I added this dashboard so that I don't have to log in to my google analytics page separately to view my page stats.

Name: Widget Twitter - http://web-dorado.com/products/wordpress-twitter-integration-plugin.html 

*Why did I choose this plugin?*

I think it's important to add a Twitter share button on your blog posts so readers can tweet posts they want to share with their followers. This will expand your reach and hopefully increase your page views.

Name: Google Analytics for WordPress - https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/google-analytics/

*Why did I choose this plugin?*

I set this up to add Google analytics tracking to my blog. I'm interested to see where my site traffic is coming from and the breakdown of who is viewing my blog.


####The Future####

I enjoy reading blog posts but have never seen myself on the other side of the fence. I hope to continue a weekly post over the next few months while I'm learning web design. After that, who knows.
